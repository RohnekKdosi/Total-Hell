Added PowerUps (Dynamite (Don't believe the text on it, it's not TNT, someone F-ed up), Shield)
Added settings for PowerUp spawning
Fixed a bug where the player would die before even being born (No, really, it said the time lasted was negative)
Settings will now be cyclically connected meaning you can just click the lower button when on minimum parameter to set it to max
Added a text telling you how many shields you have. One that tells you if a shield is active is considered now
